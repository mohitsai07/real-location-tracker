# Real-Time Location Tracker - Minimal Clone

This repository contains a simplified clone of the "Realtime Location Tracker" project.
It uses Node.js + Express + Socket.IO for real-time communication and Leaflet for map display.

## Quick start

1. Ensure Node.js (v18+) and npm are installed.
2. Extract the project and run:
   ```
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3007` in your browser.
4. Allow geolocation access when prompted to start broadcasting your device location.

## Notes
- This is a minimal, functional version to help you get started. The original project includes
  many additional features (offline map tiles, WebRTC audio, richer UI, icons, logs).
- If you want, I can add WebRTC audio, device icons, or package everything into a Dockerfile next.
